Installing TaffyScript is extremely simple. For now, it only works on Windows, but working is being done to bring it to other platforms.

## Windows

To install on windows, go to the [Download]({{site.baseurl}}/download) page. There, download the latest release. It is a zip file that contains the compiler as well as a folder for all of the official libraries that aren't a part of the Base Class Library. Unzip it wherever you want. That's all you need to do. However, I'd suggest adding the compiler directory to your PATH so it can be used anywhere.
