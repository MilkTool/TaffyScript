This section of the site provides a set of tutorials for TaffyScript. Included are basic features such as data types and objects, as well as more advanced features such as C# integration.

Many parts of this tutorial assume some prior knowledge of the C# programming language. This is not strictly necessary (especially for the basic parts), but having some knowledge of a Java-like language will be beneficial.

## What is TaffyScript

TaffyScript is a general purpose programming language. It has basic Object Oriented features, such as objects (which are like classes) and single inheritance. It is dynamic, but strongly typed. That means that it's [duck typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing), but you can't add a string and a number together. Even though it is a general purpose language, it was designed to be embedded into C# programs. In particular, to be used for the game logic of [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) applications.
