Welcome to the TaffyScript home page! Here you you can find information and resources regarding the TaffyScript programming language.

## About

TaffyScript is general purpose programming language. It is dynamic, but strongly typed. That means that it's [duck typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing), but you can't add a string and a number together.

Some of the basic features:
* Built in C#
* Compiles to a .NET assembly
* Dynamic typing
* Strongly typed
* Fast development time
* Open Source: [Github](https://github.com/mystborn/TaffyScript)
* Does not use the DLR
* Import external .NET methods and types
* Easily embedded into existing .NET applications
* Single object inheritance
* Lambdas
* Basic Reflection

## This Site

This site is hosted by github pages, and the source can be found in the [/docs](https://github.com/mystborn/TaffyScript/tree/master/docs) in the master branch of the Github repo. My sense of design is equivalent to that of a three year old, and it shows in the website. If you'd like to contribute to the site in any way, it'd be greatly appreciated. Even something as simple as choosing a better color palette could help tremendously.
